Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R.

If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy.

The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is off. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's off. So, he changes the position of knob A to the on position. Because the building will implode if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM.
